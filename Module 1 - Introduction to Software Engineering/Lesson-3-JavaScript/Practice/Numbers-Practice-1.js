// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
let variable = 10;

// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable

variable *= 2;
console.log(variable);

// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
let variable1 = 10;
let variable2 = 40;

console.log(variable1);
// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
let variable3 = 5;
let variable4 = 10;

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
let variable6 = 10;
let variable7 = 100;

// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
let variable10 = 10;

variable10 %=3
console.log (variable10);

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?

"For getting the remainder of a division AND to figure out if the number is even or odd"
