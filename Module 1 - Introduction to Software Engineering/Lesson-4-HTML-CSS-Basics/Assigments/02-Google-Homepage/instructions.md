# Google Homepage Recreation
## Objective
Your task is to recreate a version of the Google homepage as a way to practice using CSS Flexbox. This assignment is not about pixel-perfect replication but rather about understanding and applying flex containers to achieve a layout similar to the Google homepage.

## Resources Provided
- `index.html`: The HTML file with the basic structure of the page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file where you will write your Flexbox styles.
- ![Flexbox ](./google-homepage.PNG): An unmarked screenshot of the Google homepage.
- `![Flexbox ](./google-homepage-containers.PNG): A screenshot with suggested flex containers marked.

## Requirements
- Your layout should be responsive and should maintain the structure at different viewport sizes.
- Use flex containers to align elements horizontally and vertically as shown in the provided screenshots.
- Focus on the layout rather than the details. For instance, the exact size of the logo or the search bar is not crucial.

## Instructions

1. **Examine the Screenshots**: Look at both `google-homepage.png` and `google-homepage-containers.png` to understand the layout structure.

2. **Identify Flex Containers**: Use the marked screenshot to identify where flex containers should be implemented. You should see that the page can be broken down into a few main flex containers.

3. **HTML Structure**: Open `index.html` and examine the structure. Identify where you will need to add `div` tags to create flex containers.

4. **CSS Styling**: In `styles.css`, start by resetting default browser styles using a CSS reset of your choice.

5. **Implement Flexbox**: Use `display: flex;` to create flex containers. Utilize `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and other Flexbox properties to align elements as in the screenshots.

6. **Alignment and Spacing**: Pay attention to the alignment and spacing between elements within flex containers. Use `margin` and `padding` to adjust spacing where necessary.

7. **Review**: Compare your work with the provided screenshots to ensure that your page is functionally similar.
